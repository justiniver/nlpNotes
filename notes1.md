# NLP Notes

### LLMs
- LLMs works through classification
- Using a word bank (typically 40k ~ 60k words), predicts the next word
- Models have billions of 'parameters' (more on that later)

### Text Normalization
- Stems and affixes (e.g., 'cats' where 'cat' is the stem and 's' is the affix)
- We need to correct misspellings
